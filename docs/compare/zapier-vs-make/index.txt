2:T844,{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"Is Make really cheaper than Zapier?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes, significantly. Make counts \"operations\" (individual steps), while Zapier counts \"tasks\" (each action in a Zap). A 5-step automation in Zapier uses 5 tasks; in Make it uses 5 operations. At the $9/month Make plan you get 10,000 ops — enough for most small businesses. Zapier's equivalent task volume costs $49/month."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which is better for beginners?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Zapier wins for beginners. The setup wizard walks you through trigger → action in minutes. Make's canvas builder is powerful but has a steeper learning curve — expect 2-4 hours before it clicks. If you need something working today with zero frustration, start with Zapier."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can Make replace Zapier entirely?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For most use cases, yes. Make handles everything Zapier does and adds more advanced routing, data transformation, and error handling. The only real gap is app coverage: Zapier's 6,000+ integrations include many niche tools Make doesn't support yet. Check whether your specific apps are on Make before switching."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which is better for complex workflows?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Make is substantially better for complex automations. The visual canvas lets you build branching logic, parallel routes, and iterators that are impossible or very clunky in Zapier's linear format. For multi-condition workflows, data aggregation, or API-heavy processes, Make is the right tool."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does Zapier or Make work better with AI tools?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Both have solid AI integrations. Zapier has native OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google AI actions. Make has similar modules plus better HTTP/webhook support for custom AI API calls. For off-the-shelf AI actions, Zapier is easier. For custom AI pipelines, Make gives you more control."}}]}0:["RAZhviVEM4QZqFKIMyE45",[[["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["zapier-vs-make",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["zapier-vs-make",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Article\",\"headline\":\"Zapier vs Make 2026: Which Automation Tool Is Worth It?\",\"description\":\"We built 50+ automations in both Zapier and Make to find out which one saves more time and money.\",\"image\":\"https://smarttoolpicks.net/images/guides/hero-tech-premium.webp\",\"datePublished\":\"2026-02-15\",\"dateModified\":\"2026-02-26\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"SmartToolPicks\",\"url\":\"https://smarttoolpicks.net\"},\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"SmartToolPicks\",\"url\":\"https://smarttoolpicks.net\"},\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https://smarttoolpicks.net/compare/zapier-vs-make\"}}"}}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https://smarttoolpicks.net\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Compare\",\"item\":\"https://smarttoolpicks.net/compare\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"Zapier vs Make\",\"item\":\"https://smarttoolpicks.net/compare/zapier-vs-make\"}]}"}}],["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$2"}}],["$","article",null,{"className":"pt-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto","children":[["$","nav",null,{"className":"flex items-center gap-2 text-sm text-gray-400 mb-6","children":[["$","$L3",null,{"href":"/","className":"hover:text-gray-600","children":"Home"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"/"}],["$","$L3",null,{"href":"/compare","className":"hover:text-gray-600","children":"Compare"}],["$","span",null,{"children":"/"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gray-600","children":"Zapier vs Make"}]]}],["$","header",null,{"className":"mb-8","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"badge-new mb-3 inline-block","children":"Automation"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"font-display text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 leading-tight mb-4","children":"Zapier vs Make 2026: The Automation Showdown"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed","children":"We built the same 50 workflows in both tools.
