It has proper vector tools, auto-layout, component systems, and developer handoff that serious design work requires. Canva is for non-designers who need polished output fast -- social media graphics, presentations, marketing materials -- without a design background."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can Canva replace Figma for UI design?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Canva lacks the prototyping depth, component libraries, and dev-ready export that UI design requires. You cannot hand off a Canva file to a developer and expect it to work. Figma was built for product design; Canva was built for content creation. They serve different audiences."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is Figma free to use?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Figma has a free plan that allows 3 active design files and unlimited personal files. For teams, the Figma Professional plan starts at $15/editor/month (viewers are free). Canva's free plan is more generous for basic design work, but Figma's free tier is perfectly usable for freelancers and small projects."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which is better for social media content?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Canva, by a wide margin. The template library covers every social platform (Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok) with correctly sized templates updated for algorithm changes. One-click resizing, built-in stock photos, and direct scheduling integrations make Canva the clear choice for social media teams."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does the Adobe acquisition of Figma affect anything?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The Adobe/Figma acquisition was blocked by regulators in late 2023 and called off. Figma remains independent. This is good news for users who were concerned about pricing or platform changes under Adobe ownership. Figma continues to operate and develop independently."}}]}0:["RAZhviVEM4QZqFKIMyE45",[[["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["canva-vs-figma",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",{"children":["compare",{"children":["canva-vs-figma",{"children":["__PAGE__",{},[["$L1",[["$","script",null,{"type":"application/ld+json","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"Article\",\"headline\":\"Canva vs Figma 2026: Which Design Tool Fits Your Needs?\",\"description\":\"Canva for content creators, Figma for product designers.
