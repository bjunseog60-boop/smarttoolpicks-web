Notion free is solo-only. Once you pay, Notion becomes more flexible for teams that need both docs and tasks in one place."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can Notion replace Asana entirely?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Partially. Notion can handle task management through its database system, but it lacks Asana's advanced workflow automations, dependency tracking, and native reporting. For pure project tracking and team accountability, Asana is more purpose-built."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which is better for remote teams?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Both work well for remote teams. Notion excels for documentation-heavy remote cultures — async updates, wikis, meeting notes. Asana is better when your remote team needs structured project accountability with clear owners and deadlines."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How does Notion AI compare to Asana AI?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Notion AI is an add-on at $8/user/month — it helps with writing, summarizing, and generating content inside Notion pages.
