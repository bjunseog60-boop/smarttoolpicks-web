Blackmagic Design's acquisition and subsequent transformation of the software has been nothing short of revolutionary. They have built a complete, node-based, non-linear editing suite around its legendary color grading tools, and astonishingly, they give most of it away for free. The free version of DaVinci Resolve is not a crippled 'lite' edition; it's a full-featured professional application that is more powerful than many paid competitors, offering robust editing, visual effects (Fusion), audio post-production (Fairlight), and of course, its world-class color correction page."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What about the ai revolution: editing video like a document with descript?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Descript represents a fundamental paradigm shift in how we approach video editing, particularly for dialogue-heavy content like interviews, podcasts, webinars, and tutorials. Instead of scrubbing through a visual timeline, you edit the video by simply editing its automatically generated text transcript. Want to remove a sentence? Just highlight and delete the text, and Descript removes the corresponding video and audio segment with a seamless cut. This text-based workflow is incredibly intuitive and dramatically accelerates the process of creating a rough cut, allowing producers and stakeholders to make editorial decisions without needing any technical video editing skills."}}]}9:["slug","best-video-editing-software-2026","d"]

Instead of scrubbing through a visual timeline, you edit the video by simply editing its automatically generated text transcript. Want to remove a sentence? Just highlight and delete the text, and Descript removes the corresponding video and audio segment with a seamless cut. This text-based workflow is incredibly intuitive and dramatically accelerates the process of creating a rough cut, allowing producers and stakeholders to make editorial decisions without needing any technical video editing skills."}],["$","p","1",{"children":"But Descript's true power lies in its suite of AI-driven features.
